                <p><b>Napoleon Bonaparte</b> (born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 - 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French emperor and military commander who rose to prominence during the <i>French Revolution</i> and led successful campaigns during the <i>Revolutionary Wars.</i> He was the leader of the <i>French Republic</i> as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the <i>French Empire</i> as <b>Emperor of the French</b> from 1804 until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died</p>
